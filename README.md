multi-core CPU, achieves performance close to in-memory systems without having

## Getting started

[vcpkg][13] is used to manage third-party libraries, please install it before
building the project. It's highly recommanded to develop the project inside a
docker container, which can be built from this [Dockerfile][5]:

```sh
cmake --preset debug
cmake --build build/debug -j `nproc`
ctest --test-dir build/debug
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcomed and greatly appreciated! See [CONTRIBUTING.md][6] for

You can also join the [slack workspace][12] to discuss any questions or ideas.
